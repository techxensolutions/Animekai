          How does AnimeKAI compare to 9Anime, Aniwave, HiAnime, and GogoAnime?
        </h1>
        <p>
          We are a new website, so our library can't match Aniwave yet, but we
          have a larger library than HiAnime and Gogo, and we are still adding
          new titles daily. With access to multiple private trackers, we are
          confident that we will surpass Aniwave's library and even KissAnime in
          the future. At the moment, we have 10k titles, Aniwave has 12k before
          they closed, HiAnime has 7k and Gogo has 9k.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a more modern layout and better UI/UX than Gogo and 9Anime,
          making navigation on our site easy and convenient.
